## 🎯 How I approach development

- I prioritize **understanding code**, not just making it work
- I analyze and refactor components to improve structure and readability
- I use AI tools as a **learning and productivity aid**, not as a replacement for understanding
- I continuously improve by rebuilding similar components on my own
